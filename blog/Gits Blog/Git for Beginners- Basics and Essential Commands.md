What is Git

Git is a version control system that helps developers track changes in their code over time. Instead of saving multiple copies of files, Git records every change with clear messages, allowing you to view, compare, or restore any previous version of your project. It works like a time machine for code.

Git is especially useful for team collaboration. Multiple developers can work on the same project at the same time using branches, then safely merge their work together. If conflicts occur, Git highlights them so they can be resolved without losing anyone’s work.

Key concepts in Git include:

Repository: The project folder with its full history

Commit: A saved snapshot of changes with a message

Branch: A separate version of the project for working independently

Staging Area: Where you choose which changes to save

Remote: The shared online copy of the project

With a small set of commands like git add, git commit, git pull, and git push, Git provides control, safety, and clarity, making it an essential tool in modern software development.
